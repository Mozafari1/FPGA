2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.085 ns between count_int_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk) and count_int_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.273 ns between count_int_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk) and count_int_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.283 ns between count_int_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk) and count_int_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on direction relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on en relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[0] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[1] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[2] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on count_out[3] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>
